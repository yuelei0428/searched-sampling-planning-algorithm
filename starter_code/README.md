## Overview
In this assignment, you will implement and compare the performance of search-based and sampling-based motion planning algorithms on several 3-D environments.

### 1. main.py
python main.py will run the search-based motion planning algorithms

### 2. sampling_based_algorithm.py
python sampling_based_algorithm.py will run the sampling based motion planning algorithms. I used this library: https://github.com/motion-planning/rrt-algorithms

### result
Result for the 7 maps are included in the result_rrt and result_Astar folders
